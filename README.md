# ASE
Write a README.md that describes in simple terms how to build, run and test your initial service. 

The README.md should also describe all the operational entry points to your service.  As noted above, this might be a subset of your proposed entry points.  This is your "API documentation".  If certain entry points must be called in certain orders or never called in certain orders, make sure to say so.

If any third-party code is included in your codebase, also document exactly which code this is, where it resides in your codebase, and where you got it from (e.g., download url).
